# Random gallery generator

This program generates a data file containing a randomized list of photos created using the Unsplash API.

This code was created during a [live stream](https://youtu.be/_YzUpl_ip8M) to support the book [Rapid Fullstack Development](https://rapidfullstackdevelopment.com/).

This repo contains [the randomly generated gallery data](./gallery.json) that was created during the live stream.
